# Image2Text
A python script that makes a string that represent an image.

I made a python script that makes a string that represent an image. For example if you input a image of box. The script will come up with something like -
<pre>
XXXXXXXX<br>
X      X<br>
X      X<br>
X      X<br>
X      X<br>
XXXXXXXX<br>
</pre>
The script works far better than that. You can easily recognize your face if you input your image.
