# Image2Text
A python script that makes a string that represent an image.

I made a python script that makes a string that represent an image. For example if you input a image of box. The script will come up with something like -
<pre>
XXXXXXXX
X      X
X      X
X      X
X      X
XXXXXXXX
</pre>
The script works far better than that. You can easily recognize your face if you input your image.

To Use -
<ul>
  <li>Run img2txt.py
    <li>Enter the path of the image you want
      <li>Enter Height and Width of the text as you want.
        </ul>
